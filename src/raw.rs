extern "C" {
	/// Raw `msgsnd()` function; we need to use this declaration as opposed to
	/// the one in the `libc` crate due to `c_void` type bullshittery.
	/// Keep in mind that due to the lifetime implications of `*const` pointers
	/// and lifetimes, you should create the raw pointer during the function
	/// call (or as late as possible) so that you avoid dangling pointers
	///
	/// Parameters:
	/// * `msqid` - ID of the message queue in question
	/// * `msgp` - pointer to a user-defined message struct, such struct is
	///    required to have two fields: `mtype` and `mtext`, the first being
	///    a `long`/`i64` which should be positive and the latter an array
	///    or struct (but not a pointer) as chosen by the user
	/// * `msgsz` - maximum size of message (only mtext is counted) that can
	///    be read; depending on configuration, messages larger than `msgsz`
	///    will be either truncated (MSG_NOERROR flag) or the function will
	///    fail and set `errno` to `E2BIG` (default behavior)
	/// * `msgflg` - flags, see [`IpcFlags`] for more info
	pub fn msgsnd(msqid: c_int, msgp: *const Message, msgsz: size_t, msgflg: c_int) -> c_int;

	/// Raw `msgrcv()` function; see [`msgsnd()`] for more details on usage
	///
	/// Parameters:
	/// * `msqid` - ID of the message queue in question
	/// * `msgp` - pointer to a user-defined message struct, such struct is
	///    required to have two fields: `mtype` and `mtext`, the first being
	///    a `long`/`i64` which should be positive and the latter an array
	///    or struct (but not a pointer) as chosen by the user
	/// * `msgsz` - maximum size of message (only mtext is counted) that can
	///    be read; depending on configuration, messages larger than `msgsz`
	///    will be either truncated (MSG_NOERROR flag) or the function will
	///    fail and set `errno` to `E2BIG` (default behavior)
	/// * `msgflg` - flags, see [`IpcFlags`] for more info

	///   calls over the memory limit will block
	///   unless [`IpcFlags::NoWait`] is also specified
	/// * `msg_perm.uid` - UID of the owner of the queue
	///   (not the same as ID of the creator, which is
	///   saved in `msg_perm.cuid` and can't be changed)
	/// * `msg_perm.gid` - group ID of the owner of
	///   the queue (not the same as GID of the creator,
	///   which is saved in `msg_perm.cgid` and can't
	///   be modified)
	/// * the 9 least significant bits of `msg_perm.mode` -

	/// Returns systen-wide information about message queue
	/// limits and parameters. In this case, `msgctl()` expects
	/// a `msginfo` struct as a parameter. Therefore, a cast
	/// is required
	///
	/// This command is Linux specific.
	///
	/// `msginfo` has the following members with the following
	/// meanings:
	/// * `int msgpool` - Size in Kibibites of buffer pool
	///   used to hold message data; unused within kernel
	/// * `int msgmap` - maximum number of entries in message
	///   map, also unused
	/// * `int msgmax` - maximum numberr of bytes that can be
	///   written in a single message`
	/// * `int msgmnb` - maximum number of bytes that can be
	///   written to a queue; used to initialize msg_qbytes
	/// * `int msgmni` - maximum number of message queues
	/// * `int msgssz` - message segment size; unused within
	///   the Linux kernel
	/// * `int msgtql` - maximum number of messages on all
	///   queues in system; unused
	/// * `unsigned short int msgseg` - maximum number of
	///   segments; also unusued
	///
	/// The `msgmni`, `msgmax` and `msgmnb` settings can be changed
	/// through `/proc` files of the same name. These are
	/// usually located in `/proc/sys/kernel`
	///
	/// For bigger payloads it is recommended to raise `msgmax`
	ReturnInfo  = IPC_INFO,
	/// Returns a same `msgid_ds` struct as [`ControlCommands::GetOptions`]
	/// does with the exception that the `msqid` argument is not a queue
	/// identifier but instead an index into the kernel's internal array
	///
	/// This command is Linux specific and rarely used outside of kernel.
	MessageStat = MSG_STAT,
	/// Returns `msginfo` struct just like [`ControlCommands::ReturnInfo`]
	/// would do, but instead reports information about system resources
	/// consumed by message queues.
	///
	/// This command is Linux specific.
	///
	/// The changed struct members are:
	/// * `msgpool` - now returns the number of message queues that currently
	///   exist on the system
	/// * `msgmap` - now returns the total number of messages in all queues
	///   across the system
	/// * `msgtql` - now returns the total number of bytes used by messages
	///   accross the system
